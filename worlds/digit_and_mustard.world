    <!-- The physics type can be chosen bewteen ode, dart, bullet or fcl. We tested dart and ode.
         The collision_detector with dart can be bullet and fcl.
         The use of ODE as collision detector is not allowed because the ODE used by DART can clash with the ODE that ships with Gazebo. See https://github.com/dartsim/dart/issues/1425.
         The use of dart as collision detector is allowed just with very simple collision elements as sphere or boxes -->
